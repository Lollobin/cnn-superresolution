A project for the course "Deep Learning for Visual Recognition" at Aarhus University. A CNN was trained to perform Image Super-Resolution. The process and findings are documented in `deep_learning_group42.pdf`.

## Getting Started

The whole project is contained and can be executed via the Jupyter Notebook `dl-superresolution.ipynb`.
